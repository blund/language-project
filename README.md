# An attempt to make a little langauage
Pond is intended to be a small language, and mostly a playground for me to play around with compiler techniques.

So far, a basic recursive descent parser is implemented. It targets the C syntax for now.
The only thing the program currently does is parse an example "program", and print back the code from the abstrat syntax tree.
